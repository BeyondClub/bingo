LFBINGO is an onchain activity BINGO as dynamic NFT to flex how degens you are.
By minting LFBINGO’s NFT, onchain activities on each grid of the bingo NFTs will be randomly generated. 
Our system will track your wallet activity and reflect it on your bingo card. We'll query on-chain data and update your score every 24 hours.
Any protocol can use it as gamified user acquisition/engagement campaigns, as well as collaborative campaigns with other protocols. Chains like Polygon can use it to increase the engagement of protocols on top of them as well.

## Challenge
How can we create a gamified and collaborative community engagement campaigns that increases and sustain long-term engagement?

## Solution
We’ve built LFBINGO, an on-chain activity BINGO as a dynamic NFT.
Any protocol can use it as gamified user acquisition/engagement campaigns.

Users just need to 
1. Mint Bingo NFT
2. Check their Bingo and Score
3. Aim high score by completing on-chain activities

Campaigns with LFBINGO can be more
- Unique and Engaging
- Tokenized and Progressive Rewards
- Scalable and Interoperable (Cross promotion opportunities)
- Viral Potential
- Long-term value

## Potential Use Cases
Not only one protocol uses it for user acquisition or engagement, but also protocols can use it for collaborative campaigns with other protocols, and chains can use it to increase the engagement of protocols on top of them as well.
1. User acquisition/engagement campaigns of one protocol
2. Collaborative User acquisition/engagement campaigns among protocols
3. Chain’s User acquisition/engagement for protocols on top of them

## Future Update

The functionalities of dynamic NFT based on on-chain activity can be directly applied as dynamic membership NFT.
By expanding the functionality, we are planning to build a no-code Dynamic membership NFT builder, with which protocols can use to increase long-term engagement and become more valuable.
Protocols can launch tiered membership NFTs based on on-chain quests or off-chain quests like Twitter or Discord engagement so their users can unlock higher tiers.
Higher-tier members can enjoy a range of advantages, including enhanced token-gated access, increased utility, and even the potential for exclusive airdrops.

## Projects we use
Polygon : Deployed contract on Polygon Mumbai
Consensys : Utilized Infura’s ERC721 contract template to be a based of BINGO NFT
Luniverse : 
  - RPC provider.
  - The loyalty points can be stored on a blockchain, which can then be used by users to withdraw perks. The score can be viewed and verified on the blockchain.
  - Activity: Retrieve recent NFT transfers from the contract using the Web3 engine.
  - Webhook: use of the Luniverse webhook to reset the Bingo game when an NFT is transferred to a new account.

Also, we integrate the below protocols for sample quests.
Uniswap, Sushiswap, Curve, Aave, Compound, Lido, Rocket Pool, Superfluid, ENS, POAP, OpenSea, Lens, Farcaster
